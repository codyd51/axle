 * A segment is made up of zero or more sections.  Non-MH_OBJECT files have
 * all of their segments with the proper sections in each, and padded to the
 * specified segment alignment when produced by the link editor.  The first
 * segment of a MH_EXECUTE and MH_FVMLIB format file contains the mach_header
 * and load commands of the object file before its first section.  The zero
 * fill sections are always last in their segment (in all formats).  This
 * allows the zeroed segment padding to be mapped into memory where zero fill
 * sections might be. The gigabyte zero fill sections, those with the section
 * type S_GB_ZEROFILL, can only be in a segment with sections of this type.
 * These segments are then placed after all other segments.
 *
 * The MH_OBJECT format has all of its sections in one segment for
 * compactness.  There is no padding to a specified segment boundary and the
 * mach_header and load commands are not part of the segment.
 *
 * Sections with the same section name, sectname, going into the same segment,
 * segname, are combined by the link editor.  The resulting section is aligned
 * to the maximum alignment of the combined sections and is the new section's
 * alignment.  The combined sections are aligned to their original alignment in
 * the combined section.  Any padded bytes to get the specified alignment are
 * zeroed.
 *
 * The format of the relocation entries referenced by the reloff and nreloc
 * fields of the section structure for mach object files is described in the
 * header file <reloc.h>.
