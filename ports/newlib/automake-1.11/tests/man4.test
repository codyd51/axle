# Ensure `make dist' fails when help2man replacement man pages are created.
#
# The assumption here is the following: if the developer uses help2man to
# generate man pages from --help output, then these man pages may not be
# stored in VCS.  However, they should be distributed, so that the end user
# that receives the tarball doesn't have to install help2man.  If they are
# not distributed, then the developer should make help2man a prerequisite
# to building the package from a tarball, e.g., with a configure check for
# help2man that errors out if it is unavailable.  In both cases it is
# sufficient to check only distributed man pages.
#
# Idea of this whole shenanigan is to allow somebody to check out sources from
# a VCS and build and install them without needing help2man installed.  The
# installed man pages will be bogus in this case.  Typically, this happens
# when developers ask users to try out a fix from VCS; the developers themselves
# will usually have help2man installed (or should install it).
