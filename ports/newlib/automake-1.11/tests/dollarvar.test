# Test to make sure that -Wportability complains about recursive
# variable expansions and variables containing `$', `$(...)', or
# `${...}' in the name.  We support recursive variable expansions using
# the latter two constructs for the `silent-rules' option, and they are
# rather widely supported in practice.  OTOH variable definitions
# containing a `$' on the left hand side of an assignment are not
# portable in practice, even though POSIX allows them.  :-/
