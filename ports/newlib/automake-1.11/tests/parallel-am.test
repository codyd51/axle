# Test parallel automake execution.

# There are several hypotheses to be tested:  Independently of the number
# of threads used by automake,
# 0) the generated Makefile.in files must be identical without --add-missing,
# 1) the Makefile.in that distributes auxiliary files must be generated
#    after all other ones, so all installed aux files are caught,
# 2) normal automake output should have identical content and be ordered
#    in the same way, when --add-missing is not passed, or when
#    --add-missing is passed but there are no concurrent file requirements
#    (i.e., two Makefile.am files call for the same needed aux file)
# 3) normal automake output should be identical and ordered in the same way
#    with --add-missing, even with concurrent file requirements, and the
#    installation of aux files should be race-free,
# 4) warning and normal error output should be identical, in that duplicate
#    warnings should be omitted in the same way as without threads,
# 5) fatal error and debug messages could be identical.  This is not
#    intended, though.
#
# This test checks (0), (1), and (2).  See sister tests for further coverage.
